# ExportSwagger
Explore static API documentation with Spring and swagger.

Swagger is an open-source framework to document REST APIs, and it has become the de-facto standard. With spring, you can easily expose a test page for all your REST APIs using swagger-ui. The Swagger framework also allows the developers to generate API documents automatically and expose them via a web server.

The problem starts when we need to send these API documents without any server. For this purpose, I built a service to produce and expose these API documentations. This documentation will be daily updated by Jenkins automation server.
